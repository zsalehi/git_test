        <h2>You really are never ready.</h2>
        <p>Secretly, you aren’t ready to accomplish your dreams. You feel ready, you just somehow never accomplish your goals. Here’s how I learned that I am never ready.</p>

        <h3>Recognizing the problem</h3>
        <p>Realizing I even had a problem probably took me the longest to understand, but once I did it opened a window into my life which was hidden away in my mind behind some curtains. I love technology, and becoming a programmer has always been a goal of mine ever since I decided to choose business over computer science back in high school.</p>
        <p><strong>Why did I make that choice?</strong></p>
        <p>I honestly can’t remember exactly when I thought to change my path, but I think I chose business because I always felt comfortable with understanding how a company works and that I want to run my own someday. That’s the word! <em>Comfortable.</em></p>
        <p>After a whole lot of effort trying to learn to code over a span of maybe four years, I definitely understand programming way better than I did in high school but I’m not any better at it really. How could that be? This question was one I struggled with answering. I did not know what I was doing wrong. But then it hit me.</p>
